## Introduction

Bubbles takes great pleasure in looking after our people, our growing tribe and our planet. It aims to make the world a better place, by not only lifting spirits and tickling the senses, but by raising the bar too. And we donâ€™t just mean soap.

Almost everyone has unused products in the bathroom. Once at home, you found out that the product isn't doing what you hoped it would, or it doesn't suit your skin or hair. And so your bathroom cabinets, window sills and shelves become increasingly full of useless items that eventually end up in the trash. If we make products for every need, everyone can buy exactly what they need and we ultimately reduce waste.

Personal service is best for the environment. If we have a product that meets your needs, you get real value for money, we get a regular customer, consumption of unnecessary products decreases and money is no longer wasted. And what would people really want? Products that consist of rainbows, unicorns and waterfalls, you know: Bubbles products!

*   Build brand awareness for a handmade plastic-free bathing products. 
*   Clearly communicate different kinds of mproducts that are available. 
*   Provide an easy option for users to quickly make a purchase
*   Provide an option for registered users to add reviews and blog comments 

### Scope
**Functional requirements:**
*   A Navigation bar to guide the user experience across the website;
*   An About section to tell what Bubbles is all about.
*   A Latest Arrival section to showcease the new products
*   A Testimonial secton to showcase the success stories
*   A Contact section to enable customers to share theirfeedback
*   An option to create their own account in order to make quick payments in future
*   An option to add reviews to the product and add comments to blogs


**Content requirements:**

### Structure

The website was designed to deliver an intuitive experience with a consistent information flow.

**Interaction design**

The interface responds to the user actions as expected. The scroll behavior is standard and the buttons respond instantly when actioned. In order to increase the sense of interaction, subtle effects of zooming in,  highlighting and transition effects are used wherever appropriate. I have used Wow.js for animation effects

**Information architecture**

The content is organized and segregated into sections from top to bottom. The navigation bar is also categorized accordingly.

 ### Skeleton

**Wireframe mockups**

Please find attached Wireframe for Home page , place order form and acknowledgement page for Large, medium and Small devices.

## The Surface Plane

**Colors**

The color palette chosen here is aqua blue that represents the water. The lightness of the color can mean clarity of thoughts and calmness. .The color is easy on the eyes and can make anyone feel at ease. Also the contrast color that goes with aqua is Pastel Pink.

**Typography**

Two fonts were used for this project, Akaya Telivigala', cursive, and sans-serif with a sans-serif being fallback font. The cursive style fonts are a well-known typography choice, and are particularly popular on the web. Cursive writing fonts can give the website a more personal feel and approach media

# Deployment
## Heroku Deployment with AWS
This website is deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), following these steps:
1. Install these packages to your local environment, since these packages are required to deploy a Django project on Heroku.
- [gnicorn](https://gunicorn.org/): `gnicorn` is Python WSGI(web server gataway interface) server for UNIX.
- [gninx](https://www.nginx.com/): `gninx` is a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy, as well as an IMAP/POP3 proxy server.
- [psycopg2-binary](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2-binary/): `psycopg2-binary` is PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming language.
- [dj-database-url](https://pypi.org/project/dj-database-url/): `dj-database-url` allows you to utilize the 12factor inspired DATABASE_URL environment variable to configure your Django application.
2. Create a `requirements.txt` file and freeze all the modules with the command `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt` in the terminal.
3. Create a `Procfile` write `web: gunicorn boutique_ado.wsgi:application` in the file.
4. `git add` and `git commit` and `git push` all the changes to the Github repositoty of this project.
5. Go to Heroku and create a **new app**. Set a name for this app and select the closest region (Europe) and click **Create app**.
6. Go to **Resources** tab in Heroku, then in the **Add-ons** search bar look for **Heorku Postgres**(you can type postgres), select **Hobby Dev â€” Free** and click **Submit Order Form** button to add it to your project.
7. In the heroku dashboard for the application, click on **Setting** > **Reveal Config Vars** and set the values as follows:

| Key | Value |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | `Your AWS Access Key` |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | `Your AWS Secret Access Key` |
| DATABASE_URL | `Your Postgres Database URL` |
| EMAIL_HOST_PASS | `Your Email Password (generated by Gmail)` |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER | `Your Email Address` |
| SECRET_KEY | `Your Secret Key` |
| STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | `Your Stripe Public Key` |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | `Your Stripe Secret Key` | 
| STRIPE_WH_SECRET | `Your Stripe WH Key` |
| USE_AWS | `True` |

* I used [Djecrety](https://djecrety.ir/) to generate Django Secret Key.

8. Comment out the current database setting in settings.py, and add the code below instead. This is done temporarily to migrate the datbase on Heroku.
```
  DATABASES = {     
        'default': dj_database_url.parse("<your Postrgres database URL here>")     
    }
```
9. Migrate the database models to the Postgres database using the following commands in the terminal:
`python3 manage.py migrate`
10. Load the data fixtures(color_table, flower_table, image_table, product_table) into the Postgres database using the following command:
`python3 manage.py loaddata <fixture_name>`
11. Create a superuser for the Postgres database by running the following command:
`python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
12. Replace the database setting with the code below, so that the right database is used depending on development/deployed environment.
```
if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }
else:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
        }
    }
```
13. Disable collect static, so that Heroku won't try to collect static file with: `heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1`
14. Add `'ms4-bubbles.herokuapp.com', 'localhost', '127.0.0.1'` to `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in settings.py.
```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['ms4-bubbles.herokuapp.com', 'localhost', '127.0.0.1']
```
15. In Stripe, add Heroku app URL a new webhook endpoint.
16. Update the settings.py with the new Stripe environment variables and email settings.
17. Commit all the changes to Heroku. Medial files are not connected to the app yet but the app should be working on Heroku.

### Amazon Web Service S3
The static files and media files for this deployed site (e.g. image files for product/blog) are hosted in the [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) S3 Bucket. You will need to create S3 bucket, complete the setting up and upload static files and media files to the S3 bucket. You can find [Amazon S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html) for more information on the setting.
I used CORS configuration below:
```
[
  {
      "AllowedHeaders": [
          "Authorization"
      ],
      "AllowedMethods": [
          "GET"
      ],
      "AllowedOrigins": [
          "*"
      ],
      "ExposeHeaders": []
  }
]
```

- Setting for static/media files in settings.py
1. Install `boto3` and `django-storages` with a command `pip3 install boto3` and `pip3 install django-storages` in your terminal, to connect AWS S3 bucket to Django.
2. Add 'storages' to `INSTALLED_APPS` in settings.py.
3. Add the following in settings.py.
```
if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
    # Cache Control
    AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
        'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
        'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
    }

    # Bucket Config
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'ms4-bubbles'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'eu-central-1'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.getenv('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.getenv('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com'

    # Static and media files
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
    STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
    MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

    # Override static and media URLs in production
    STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
    MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
```
