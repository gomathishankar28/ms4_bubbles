## Introduction

Bubbles takes great pleasure in looking after our people, our growing tribe and our planet. It aims to make the world a better place, by not only lifting spirits and tickling the senses, but by raising the bar too. And we donâ€™t just mean soap.

Almost everyone has unused products in the bathroom. Once at home, you found out that the product isn't doing what you hoped it would, or it doesn't suit your skin or hair. And so your bathroom cabinets, window sills and shelves become increasingly full of useless items that eventually end up in the trash. If we make products for every need, everyone can buy exactly what they need and we ultimately reduce waste.

Personal service is best for the environment. If we have a product that meets your needs, you get real value for money, we get a regular customer, consumption of unnecessary products decreases and money is no longer wasted. And what would people really want? Products that consist of rainbows, unicorns and waterfalls, you know: Bubbles products!

### Structure

The website was designed to deliver an intuitive experience with a consistent information flow.

**Interaction design**

The interface responds to the user actions as expected. The scroll behavior is standard and the buttons respond instantly when actioned. In order to increase the sense of interaction, subtle effects of zooming in,  highlighting and transition effects are used wherever appropriate. I have used Wow.js for animation effects

**Information architecture**

The content is organized and segregated into sections from top to bottom. The navigation bar is also categorized accordingly.

### Security

Using config variables in heroku, all SECRET access keys are stored safely to prevent unwanted connections to the database.

Django allauth was used to set up user registration and built in decorators allowed restricted access to certain features on the website that are not intended for regular users.

## The Surface Plane

**Colors**

The color palette chosen here is aqua blue that represents the water t As a symbolic representation of all the blue collared services being listed on this site, this aims to have a quick recall with the users. 

**Typography**

Two fonts were used for this project, Akaya Telivigala', cursive, and sans-serif with a sans-serif being fallback font. The cursive style fonts are a well-known typography choice, and are particularly popular on the web. Cursive writing fonts can give the website a more personal feel and approach media.
