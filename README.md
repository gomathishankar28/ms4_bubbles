## Introduction

Bubbles takes great pleasure in looking after our people, our growing tribe and our planet. It aims to make the world a better place, by not only lifting spirits and tickling the senses, but by raising the bar too. And we donâ€™t just mean soap.

Almost everyone has unused products in the bathroom. Once at home, you found out that the product isn't doing what you hoped it would, or it doesn't suit your skin or hair. And so your bathroom cabinets, window sills and shelves become increasingly full of useless items that eventually end up in the trash. If we make products for every need, everyone can buy exactly what they need and we ultimately reduce waste.

Personal service is best for the environment. If we have a product that meets your needs, you get real value for money, we get a regular customer, consumption of unnecessary products decreases and money is no longer wasted. And what would people really want? Products that consist of rainbows, unicorns and waterfalls, you know: Bubbles products!
